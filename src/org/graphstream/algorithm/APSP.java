/**
 * All-pair shortest paths lengths.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This class implements the Floyd-Warshall all pair shortest path algorithm
 * where the shortest path from any node to any destination in a given weighted
 * graph (with positive or negative edge weights) is performed.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The computational complexity is O(n^3), this may seems a very large, however
 * this algorithm may perform better than running several Dijkstra on all node
 * pairs of the graph (that would be of complexity O(n^2 log(n))) when the graph
 * becomes dense.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that all the possible paths are not explicitly computed and stored.
 * Instead, the weight is computed and a data structure similar to network
 * routing tables is created directly on the graph. This allows a linear
 * reconstruction of the wanted paths, on demand, minimizing the memory
 * consumption.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For each node of the graph, a {@link org.graphstream.algorithm.APSP.APSPInfo} attribute is stored. The name of
 * this attribute is {@link org.graphstream.algorithm.APSP.APSPInfo#ATTRIBUTE_NAME}.
 * </p>
 * <h2>Usage</h2>
 * <p>
 * The implementation of this algorithm is made with two main classes that
 * reflect the two main steps of the algorithm that are:
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>compute pairwise weights for all nodes;</li>
 * <li>retrieve actual paths from some given sources to some given destinations.
 * </li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <p>
 * For the first step (the real shortest path computation) you need to create an
 * APSP object with 3 parameters:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>a reference to the graph to be computed;</li>
 * <li>a string that indicates the name of the attribute to consider for the
 * weighting;</li>
 * <li>a boolean that indicates whether the computation considers edges
 * direction or not.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Those 3 parameters can be set in a ran in the constructor
 * {@link #APSP(Graph,String,boolean)} or by using separated setters (see example
 * below).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Then the actual computation takes place by calling the {@link #compute()} method
 * which is implemented from the "Algorithm" interface. This method actually
 * does the computation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Secondly, when the weights are computed, one can retrieve paths with the help
 * of another class: "APSPInfo". Such object are stored in each node and hold
 * routing tables that can help rebuild shortest paths.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Retrieving an "APSPInfo" instance from a node is done for instance for a
 * node of id "F", like this::
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * APSPInfo info = graph.getNode("F").getAttribute(APSPInfo.ATTRIBUTE_NAME);
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * then the shortest path from a "F" to another node (say "A") is given by::
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * info.getShortestPathTo("A")
 * </pre>
 * 
 *

 * 
 * <h2>Other Features</h2>
 * 
 * <h3>Digraphs</h3>
 * <p>
 * This algorithm can use directed graphs and only compute paths according to
 * this direction. You can choose to ignore edge orientation by calling
 * {@link #setDirected(boolean)} method with "false" as value (or use the
 * appropriate constructor).
 * </p>
 * 
 * 
 * <h2>Shortest Paths with weighted edges</2>
 * <p>
 * You can also specify that edges have "weights" or "importance" that value
 * them. You store these values as attributes on the edges. The default name for
 * these attributes is "weight" but you can specify it using the
 * {@link #setWeightAttributeName(String)} method (or by using the appropriate
 * constructor). The weight attribute must contain an object that implements
 * java.lang.Number.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h2>How shortest paths are stored in the graph?</h2>
 * <p>
 * All the shortest paths are not literally stored in the graph because it would
 * require to much memory to do so. Instead, only useful data, allowing the fast
 * reconstruction of any path, is stored. The storage approach is alike network
 * routing tables where each node maintains a list of all possible targets
 * linked with the next hop neighbor to go through.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Technically, on each node, for each target, we only store the target node
 * name and if the path is made of more than one edge, one "pass-by" node. As
 * all shortest path that is made of more than one edge is necessarily made of
 * two other shortest paths, it is easy to reconstruct a shortest path between
 * two arbitrary nodes knowing only a pass-by node. This approach still stores a
 * lot of data on the graph, however far less than if we stored complete paths.
 * </p>

 * @complexity O(n^3) with n the number of nodes.
