/**
 * An implementation of the A* algorithm.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A* computes the shortest path from a node to another in a graph. It guarantees
 * that the path found is the shortest one, given its heuristic is admissible,
 * and a path exists between the two nodes. It will fail if the two nodes are in
 * two distinct connected components.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * In this A* implementation, the various costs (often called g, h and f) are
 * given by a {@link org.graphstream.algorithm.AStar.Costs} class. This class
 * must provide a way to compute:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The cost of moving from a node to another, often called g;</li>
 * <li>The estimated cost from a node to the destination, the heuristic, often
 * noted h;</li>
 * <li>f is the sum of g and h and is computed automatically.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * By default the {@link org.graphstream.algorithm.AStar.Costs} implementation
 * used uses a heuristic that always returns 0. This makes A* an * equivalent of
 * the Dijkstra algorithm, but also makes it less efficient.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * If there are several equivalent shortest paths between the two nodes, the returned
 * one is arbitrary. Therefore this AStar algorithm works with multi-graphs but if two
 * edges between two nodes have the same properties, the one that will be chosen will
 * be arbitrary. 
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h2>Usage</h2>
 * 
 * <p>The basic usage is to create an instance of A* (optionally specify a {@link Costs}
 * object), then to ask it to compute from a shortest path from one target to one
 * destination, and finally to ask for that path:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * AStart astar = new AStar(graph); 
 * astar.compute("A", "Z"); // with A and Z node identifiers in the graph. 
 * Path path = astar.getShortestPath();
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * The advantage of A* is that it can consider any cost function to drive the
 * search. You can (and should) create your own cost functions implementing the
 * {@link org.graphstream.algorithm.AStar.Costs} interface.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can also test the default euclidean "distance" cost function on a graph that has
 * "x" and "y" values. You specify the {@link Costs} function before calling the
 * {@link #compute(String,String)} method:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * AStart astar = new AStar(graph); 
 * astar.setCosts(new DistanceCosts());
 * astar.compute("A", "Z"); 
 * Path path = astar.getShortestPath();
 * </pre>
